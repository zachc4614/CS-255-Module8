DrivePass was essentially creating an application for a company trying to create Driver's training for individuals. It included a variety of packages that could give users the ability to study the most current DMV material to obtain their driver's license while also allowing them to have hands on driving training with one of the individuals that work for DriverPass. I would improve my UML Diagrams as I feel they aren't as in-depth as they could be. There is always room for improvement in this. The user's needs is the most significant thing when developing something like this. In this day and age things needs to be user friendly because it is moreso of an expectation versus a want. You have to create this looking at it like you are the user and how you would like to exeperience this. Nothing should be overly difficult by any means and it should be very easy for anyone to understand. For designing the software and using analysis and design I looked into different varieties of similar applications. Versitility is the best way to approach this while also keeping that simplicity users are used to in this day and age when utilizing software.
